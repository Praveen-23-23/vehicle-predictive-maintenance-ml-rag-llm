# 🚗 Vehicle Predictive Maintenance using ML + RAG + LLM

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent vehicle predictive maintenance system that combines:

- Machine Learning (Random Forest) for failure probability prediction
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain knowledge grounding
- Large Language Models (LLM) for contextual risk interpretation and explanation

The system is fully data-driven, non-rule-based, and designed to reflect real-world predictive maintenance workflows.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In vehicle and industrial systems, failures are rare but costly.  
Traditional rule-based systems struggle to capture complex interactions between sensor variables.

This project aims to:
- Predict failure probability from historical sensor data
- Interpret risk contextually (no fixed thresholds)
- Generate human-readable maintenance explanations
- Avoid hard-coded rules entirely

🔍 Key Design Principles
❌ No rule-based thresholds (e.g., no “if torque > X”)

✅ Risk emerges from probability + context

✅ LLM performs interpretation, not prediction

✅ Knowledge grounding via RAG

✅ Hardware-aware design

📊 Dataset
Predictive maintenance sensor dataset

Features include:

Air temperature [K]

Process temperature [K]

Rotational speed [rpm]

Torque [Nm]

Tool wear [min]

Target: Machine failure (rare event)

The dataset is naturally imbalanced, reflecting real operational conditions.

⚙️ How the System Works
Random Forest predicts failure probability

RAG retrieves relevant maintenance knowledge

LLM interprets probability + context

Final risk and explanation are generated

No hard thresholds are used.

🧪 Example Output
FINAL RISK: MEDIUM

FINAL EXPLANATION:
The failure probability suggests an elevated risk compared to normal operation.
While no immediate failure is indicated, the combination of increased tool wear
and thermal stress may accelerate component degradation. Preventive inspection
is recommended.

🧩 Why This Is Not Rule-Based
Component	Role
ML Model	Learns from data
Probability	Continuous uncertainty
RAG	Knowledge grounding
LLM	Contextual reasoning
Code	No decision rules
⚠️ Performance Note

Local LLM inference may take 20–40 seconds on CPU

This is a hardware limitation, not a design flaw

In production, LLM explanations are typically on-demand or API-based

📈 Future Improvements
Time-series degradation modeling

Batch reporting

FastAPI backend

Streamlit dashboard

Confidence visualization

🧠 Key Takeaway
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Large Language Models can work together to produce explainable, non-rule-based predictive maintenance decisions.
